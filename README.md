## Welcome

I'm a Computer-Science student from Germany @Tu-Darmstadt with a passion for offensive security, exploit and malware development.  

```c
#define SLOGAN "Skidding-through-the-moon\n"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf(SLOGAN);

    char name[] = "Zin0d";
    char whoami[] = "Student";
    int age = 20;
    char passion[] = "Hacking";

    }
